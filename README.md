# Message in a Bottle
Message in a Bottle is a small application designed to empower users to explore messages inscribed by fellow participants. These messages are thoughtfully placed within virtual bottles, creating an experience of serendipitous discovery.

Posting messages is an exclusive privilege reserved for authenticated users, strategically implemented to enhance traceability and streamline content moderation. However, the system equally offers support for anonymous authentication, facilitating the sharing of messages while safeguarding the sender's identity.

# Open Source Commitment
This project is open source, allowing anyone to examine the code and verify the integrity of their anonymity. We are dedicated to adhering to industry best practices, ensuring transparency and accountability in our codebase.
